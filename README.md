# project-injury-prediction
Project Overview

This project aims to predict sports injury risks using machine learning models based on athlete biometrics, training intensity, and recovery patterns. The model helps in identifying potential injury risks and provides actionable insights for athletes and coaches.

Research Question

How can machine learning models predict sports injury risks based on athlete biometrics, training intensity, and recovery patterns?

Dataset

Source: Kaggle Injury Prediction Dataset 

Format: CSV



Project Structure


Installation & Setup (Google Colab)

Upload the dataset to Google Drive.

Mount Google Drive in Colab:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

Run the provided script in injury_prediction.ipynb.

Model Workflow

Load and explore data

Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle missing values, feature scaling)

Split data into training and test sets

Train a baseline model (Random Forest)

Evaluate model performance

Visualize feature importance

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Model Performance

The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature importance analysis helps understand key factors in injury prediction.

Future Improvements

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.

Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.

Integrate real-time injury risk monitoring.
